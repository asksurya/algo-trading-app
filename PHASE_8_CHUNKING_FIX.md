# Phase 8: Intelligent Data Chunking Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Report
**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Reported By:** User  
**Problem:** System hanging when analyzing 10 tickers with all strategies from Jan 1, 1990 to present (~35 years of data)

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
1. **Single Large API Calls**: Attempting to fetch 35 years (12,775 days) of historical data in single requests
2. **API Timeouts**: Alpaca API timing out or rate limiting on very large date ranges
3. **No Chunking Logic**: Backend had no mechanism to break large requests into manageable pieces
4. **Wrong Fix Attempted**: Initial reaction was to add validation limits (blocking users) instead of solving the underlying issue

### Impact
- Users blocked from analyzing long-term historical data
- System appears "hung" with no progress feedback
- No way to perform comprehensive multi-year backtests
- Poor user experience

## Solution Implemented

### Architecture: Intelligent Data Chunking

Instead of **blocking users with limits**, we implemented **automatic data chunking** that transparently handles requests of any size.

### 1. Backend Chunking Logic

**File:** `backend/app/backtesting/runner.py`

**New Method:** `_fetch_historical_data()` with automatic chunking

```python
def _fetch_historical_data(symbol, start_date, end_date):
    date_range_days = (end_date - start_date).days
    
    # Small ranges: Direct fetch (≤ 180 days)
    if date_range_days <= 180:
        return fetch_single_chunk(symbol, start_date, end_date)
    
    # Large ranges: Chunk into 6-month periods
    chunks = []
    current_start = start_date
    chunk_size = 180  # ~6 months
    
    while current_start < end_date:
        current_end = min(current_start + timedelta(days=180), end_date)
        chunk = fetch_single_chunk(symbol, current_start, current_end)
        chunks.append(chunk)
        current_start = current_end + timedelta(days=1)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Rate limit protection
    
    # Combine, deduplicate, sort
    return combine_chunks(chunks)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Detection**: Detects large date ranges (>180 days)
- **Smart Chunking**: Breaks into 6-month periods
- **Rate Limiting**: 0.1s delay between chunks
- **Progress Logging**: Detailed logs for monitoring
- **Error Resilience**: Individual chunk failures don't break entire job
- **Data Quality**: Deduplication and sorting of combined data

### 2. Removed Validation Limits

**File:** `backend/app/api/v1/optimizer.py`

**Removed:**
- ❌ Maximum 10 symbols limit
- ❌ Maximum 2 years (730 days) date range
- ❌ Maximum 100 backtests limit

**Added:**
- ✅ Basic validation (end date > start date)
- ✅ Informational logging for large requests
- ✅ No blocking - all requests allowed

**File:** `frontend/src/app/dashboard/optimizer/page.tsx`

**Removed:**
- ❌ Frontend validation blocking
- ❌ Error messages preventing submission

**Added:**
- ✅ Informative warnings for large datasets
- ✅ Message: "Data will be fetched in chunks"
- ✅ Estimated time information

## Performance Characteristics

### Chunking Performance

**Example: 35 years of data (Jan 1990 - Oct 2025)**

```
Date Range: 12,775 days
Chunk Size: 180 days (~6 months)
Number of Chunks: ~71 chunks

Per-Chunk Performance:
- API Call: ~0.5-1.0 seconds
- Data Processing: ~0.1-0.2 seconds
- Rate Limit Delay: 0.1 seconds
- Total per chunk: ~1-1.5 seconds

Total Fetch Time: 71 chunks × 1.5s = ~107 seconds (~2 minutes)
```

### Full Optimization Performance

**Scenario: 10 tickers × 10 strategies × 35 years**

```
Total Backtests: 100
Per-Backtest Time: ~2 minutes (data fetch + analysis)
Sequential: ~200 minutes (~3.3 hours)
With batching (5 parallel): ~40 minutes

Recommendation: Run overnight or during off-hours for very large datasets
```

### Optimization by Dataset Size

| Dataset | Tickers | Date Range | Strategies | Est. Time | Recommended |
|---------|---------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Small   | 2-3     | 6 months   | All (~10)  | 2-5 min   | ✅ Quick test |
| Medium  | 5       | 2 years    | All (~10)  | 10-15 min | ✅ Good for exploration |
| Large   | 10      | 5 years    | All (~10)  | 30-45 min | ⚠️ Long lunch break |
| X-Large | 10      | 35 years   | All (~10)  | 3-4 hours | ⚠️ Run overnight |

## User Experience Flow

### Before Fix (Blocked)
```
1. User enters: 10 tickers, Jan 1990 - present
2. Frontend validation error: "Date range too large"
3. User cannot proceed
4. User frustrated ❌
```

### After Fix (Chunked)
```
1. User enters: 10 tickers, Jan 1990 - present
2. Warning: "Large analysis - will take several minutes"
3. Job starts, status shows "Running backtests"
4. Backend chunks data automatically:
   - Chunk 1/71: Jan-Jun 1990 ✓
   - Chunk 2/71: Jul-Dec 1990 ✓
   - ... (progress continues)
5. Results delivered when complete ✓
6. User can navigate away and return ✓
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Chunking Algorithm

**Pseudocode:**
```python
function fetch_with_chunking(symbol, start, end):
    days = (end - start).days
    
    if days <= 180:
        # Fast path: single request
        return fetch_single(symbol, start, end)
    
    # Slow path: chunked requests
    chunks = []
    current = start
    
    while current < end:
        chunk_end = min(current + 180 days, end)
        data = fetch_single(symbol, current, chunk_end)
        chunks.append(data)
        current = chunk_end + 1 day
        sleep(0.1)  # Rate limiting
    
    # Merge strategy
    combined = concat(chunks)
    combined = sort_by_date(combined)
    combined = remove_duplicates(combined)
    
    return combined
```

### Data Integrity

**Overlap Handling:**
- Chunks may have overlapping dates at boundaries
- Deduplication removes any repeated dates
- Index-based deduplication: `df[~df.index.duplicated(keep='first')]`

**Sorting:**
- All data sorted chronologically after merge
- Ensures backtest engine receives data in correct order

**Completeness Check:**
- Logs number of bars fetched vs expected
- Warning if significant gaps detected

## Production Considerations

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Redis Job Queue**
   - Replace in-memory job storage
   - Enable multi-server deployments
   - Persist jobs across restarts

2. **Progress Granularity**
   - Track progress per chunk
   - Show "Fetching data: chunk 15/71"
   - Update progress bar dynamically

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache fetched historical data
   - Reuse for multiple strategies
   - Reduce API calls by 90%+

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement token bucket algorithm
   - Respect Alpaca's rate limits
   - Queue requests during peak times

5. **Error Recovery**
   - Retry failed chunks (3 attempts)
   - Skip problematic date ranges
   - Continue with partial data

### Resource Usage

**Memory:**
- Per chunk: ~5-10 MB
- Peak memory: ~500 MB for 71 chunks
- Cleanup after merge: Returns to baseline

**API Calls:**
- 10 tickers × 71 chunks = 710 API calls
- Within Alpaca's limits (200/min)
- Spread over ~2 hours = ~6 calls/min

**Database:**
- Results stored per backtest
- ~100 KB per backtest result
- 100 backtests × 100 KB = 10 MB total
