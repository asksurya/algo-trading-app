# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment - Quick Guide

## ✅ The Error is Fixed!

The issue was that the app was trying to import from local config files (`config/alpaca_config.py`) which don't exist on Streamlit Cloud.

**Solution:** The code now automatically uses Streamlit secrets when deployed to the cloud.

## 📝 Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Streamlit Cloud deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New app"
4. Select your repository
5. Choose `app.py` as the main file
6. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Add Secrets (Optional but Recommended)

For live trading and sentiment analysis features:

1. Click "⋮" menu on your app
2. Select "Settings"
3. Go to "Secrets" tab
4. Add your API keys:

```toml
# Alpaca API (for live/paper trading)
ALPACA_API_KEY = "your_alpaca_key"
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = "your_alpaca_secret"

# NewsAPI (for sentiment analysis)
NEWSAPI_KEY = "your_newsapi_key"

# Alpha Vantage (for sentiment analysis)
ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY = "your_alphavantage_key"
```

5. Click "Save"

**Note:** Without API keys, the app will still work! It will use Yahoo Finance for data and skip live trading features.

## 🎉 Done!

Your app is now live and accessible from:
- Desktop computers
- iPhone/iPad
- Android devices
- Any device with a browser

### Add to iPhone Home Screen:
1. Open your app URL in Safari
2. Tap the Share button
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. Your app is now an icon on your home screen!

## 🔧 How It Works Now

The code automatically detects the environment:

**On Streamlit Cloud:**
- Uses `st.secrets` for API keys
- Reads from Secrets settings (encrypted)
- Falls back to Yahoo Finance if no keys

**Locally:**
- Tries `config/alpaca_config.py` first
- Falls back to Yahoo Finance if not found
- Works without any API keys for basic features

## 📱 Features That Work Without API Keys

- ✅ Backtesting (all 11 strategies)
- ✅ Strategy comparison
- ✅ Historical data (via Yahoo Finance)
- ✅ Diagnostics
- ✅ All visualizations

## 🔑 Features That Need API Keys

- 🔐 Live/Paper trading (needs Alpaca)
