## Quick Start for End Users

### 1. Configure API Key
- Go to Settings → API Keys
- Paste your Alpaca API key (gets encrypted and stored)

### 2. Create Live Strategy
- Navigate to Live Trading → Create Strategy
- Select a base strategy
- Add symbols to monitor (e.g., AAPL, MSFT)
- Set check interval (5-15 min recommended)
- Configure risk limits
- Leave auto-execute OFF initially to test

### 3. Monitor Signals
- Watch dashboard for signals detected
- Verify signals are correct before enabling auto-execute

### 4. Enable Auto-Execution
- Once comfortable, enable auto-execute
- Strategy will now trade automatically

### 5. Monitor Performance
- Check dashboard for P&L
- Review signal history
- Adjust parameters as needed

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No API key found" error**
- Solution: Configure API key in Settings → API Keys

**Strategy stuck in ERROR status**
- Solution: Check logs, fix issue, click Start again

**No signals detected**
- Solution: Market may be closed, or strategy conditions not met

**Positions not showing**
- Solution: Only BUY signals create positions, SELL closes them
