# 🔐 Security & Authentication Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE RESOLVED

**Problem:** Anyone with your Streamlit Cloud URL could access your app and trade with your Alpaca API keys.

**Solution:** Password authentication has been added to protect your app.

## 🛡️ How Authentication Works

### What's Protected:
- ✅ **Main App** (app.py) - Password required
- ⚠️ **Live Trading Page** - Add auth (see below)
- ⚠️ **Diagnostics Page** - Add auth (see below)

### How It Works:
1. User opens your app
2. Login screen appears
3. User enters password
4. Password is hashed and compared with secret
5. Access granted if correct
6. Session persists until browser closed

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set Your Password in Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Click on your app
3. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets**
4. Add this:

```toml
APP_PASSWORD = "YourStrongPasswordHere123!"
```

5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Add Auth to Other Pages (Optional but Recommended)

To add authentication to Live Trading and Diagnostics pages:

**For `pages/live_trading.py`:**

Add these lines at the top (after imports):
```python
import streamlit as st

# Authentication - MUST BE FIRST
import sys
sys.path.append('..')
from auth import require_auth
require_auth()

import pandas as pd
# ... rest of imports
```

**For `pages/diagnostics.py`:**

Same as above - add the auth block after the streamlit import.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Choose a Strong Password:
- ✅ At least 12 characters
- ✅ Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
- ✅ Not related to your name/email
- ❌ Don't use common words
- ❌ Don't reuse passwords

### Example Strong Passwords:
- `Tr@d1ng!Secur3#2025`
- `MyAlg0$App*P@ssw0rd`
- `B3st!Strat3gy#K3y`

### Additional Security:
1. **Keep URL Private** - Don't share your Streamlit Cloud URL publicly
2. **Use Paper Trading** - Test with paper money first
3. **Monitor Access** - Check Streamlit Cloud logs regularly
4. **Rotate Passwords** - Change password every 3-6 months
5. **Limit API Permissions** - Use Alpaca's permission settings

## 🚨 If Someone Gets Your Password:

1. **Immediately change** APP_PASSWORD in Streamlit secrets
2. **Regenerate** your Alpaca API keys
3. **Check** your Alpaca account for unauthorized trades
4. **Review** Streamlit Cloud logs

## 📱 Mobile Access

Authentication works on mobile:
1. Open URL on phone
2. Enter password
3. Add to home screen for convenience
4. Session stays logged in

## 🔓 Logout

Currently, logout happens when:
- Browser/tab is closed
- Session expires (Streamlit default)

To add a logout button, you can use:
```python
from auth import logout
if st.button("Logout"):
    logout()
```

## ✅ Verification

After setup, verify security:
1. Close all browser tabs
2. Open your Streamlit Cloud URL
3. Should see login screen
4. Enter password
5. Should see main app

If you don't see login screen, check:
- APP_PASSWORD is set in Streamlit secrets
- auth.py file exists in project root
- No syntax errors in app.py

## 🎯 Security Status

**Current Protection Level:**
- 🔒 **Main App**: PROTECTED ✓
- ⚠️ **Live Trading**: Add auth recommended
- ⚠️ **Diagnostics**: Add auth recommended
- 🔒 **API Keys**: Stored in Streamlit secrets (encrypted)
- 🔒 **Password**: Hashed with SHA-256

**Risk Level:** 
- Without auth on subpages: MEDIUM
- With auth on all pages: LOW

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Different Passwords** for Streamlit app vs Alpaca account
2. **Enable 2FA** on your Alpaca account
3. **Set Position Limits** in risk management settings
4. **Use Paper Trading** until comfortable
5. **Monitor Regularly** - Check trades daily

## 🆘 Support

If authentication isn't working:
1. Check Streamlit Cloud logs for errors
2. Verify APP_PASSWORD is set correctly
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Check auth.py file exists and has no errors
